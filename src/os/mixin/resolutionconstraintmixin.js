/**
 * OL3 does not have a way to provide resolution constraints to a view. Rather than extending the
 * view and getting frustrated by the number of private functions that we can't override without
 * suppressions, we'll just override the constraint that the default view uses.
 *
 * The change here is to actually get rid of the "snap" part of "snapToPower". So rather than
 * snapping to whole increments of the zoom factor, it allows fractional deltas and computes from
 * that. This probably could have also been accomplished by setting the "zoomFactor" option on the
 * view and specifying drastically different minZoom/maxZoom values, but that would be unintuitive
 * to people configuring the application.
 *
 * @param {number} power Power.
 * @param {number} maxResolution Maximum resolution.
 * @param {number=} opt_maxLevel Maximum level.
 * @return {ol.ResolutionConstraintType} Zoom function.
 * @suppress {accessControls|duplicate}
