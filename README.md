## About

Open Sphere is an application used to visualize temporal/geospatial data. The application represents data using both two and three-dimensional models of the earth, and has the ability to handle large volumes of features and tiles. The core of the application is
based on Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards. 

OpenSphere was developed at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) in collaboration with BIT Systems. The government has "unlimited rights" and is releasing this software to increase the impact of government investments by providing developers with the opportunity to take things in new directions. The software use, modification, and distribution rights are stipulated within the Apache license.
