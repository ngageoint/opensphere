Please use the `GitHub Issue Tracker`_. As always, please search first to see if your issue has already been submitted. A minimum code sample to reproduce is also helpful.

Learning the Code
-----------------

Our API contains many extensions to the OpenLayers_ API, so it would help to get familiar with Layers, Sources, Features, and Geometries from some of their examples_  and documentation_.

There are ``readme.md`` files placed in various packages to help explain the different stacks. The root readme_ has a high level overview of everything.

.. _OpenLayers: https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers
.. _examples: https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/
.. _documentation: https://openlayers.org/en/latest/apidoc/
.. _readme: https://github.com/openlayers/openlayers/blob/master/src/README.md

Contributing Code
-----------------

Our `developer guide`_ has an overview of the build system, development, and testing the application in both compiled and debug modes.

We prefer that all contributions take place through `pull requests`_. Please ensure that your pull request passes our pull request checklist.
